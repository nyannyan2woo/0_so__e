# Community Bridge

Community Bridge is a modular and extensible compatibility layer for FiveM, designed to unify development across major roleplay frameworks. It provides a consistent API that simplifies integration between popular frameworks such as QBCore, ESX, QBox, and custom solutions.

By bridging core game systems including inventory, dispatch, targeting, door locks, vehicle keys, clothing, fuel, and more, Community Bridge reduces duplicated effort and streamlines script compatibility across servers.

## Why is there a fork?
This fork is maintained specifically for users of MrNewbScripts and serves as a testbed for newer or experimental features that are not yet merged into the main org.

The goals of this fork are:

Safe testing of new functionality without affecting the official project

Faster hotfixes when issues arise in MrNewbScripts-dependent environments

A reliable legacy version that remains stable and usable even if life events or downtime prevent immediate updates to the main repository

Zero disruption to the upstream project, keeping all experiments isolated and non-invasive

If you use MrNewbScripts resources, this fork ensures you always have a compatible version of Community Bridge without a need to wait.
