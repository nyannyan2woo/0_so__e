### Installation

- Step 1: Extract the script from the zip file and place it into your scripts folder.
- Step 4: Configure the config.lua file to work with your server by changing the Framework, Inventory, Dispatch, Interaction System name.
- Step 5: Make sure that the Framework, ox_lib, your Interaction System, Dispatch, and Inventory are started before the robbery script.

### Add this to the server.cfg

```lua
  ensure ox_lib -- This should be placed under ensure qb-core in your server.cfg, if you just downloaded it
```
